This website is for a fictional community lead group called the Arboreal Community Foundation (ACF). 
The purpose of this foundation is to educate and provide resources related to taking care of trees, as well as some related activities
The target audience are gardeners and DIY oriented people 

This version includes a sign-up page with a form, and a "statistics" page with a sortable table. The signup and statistics menu buttons now work.

notes for myself:


animations are done in CSS, not in JS. i need to give an element a transition property:
    >transision: 0.5s;
other properties like ease-in and ease-out exist as well to specify the timing of the animation

specific rounded corners can be sone by putting 4 different values to the border-radius property

inherit: element inherits the value from its parent element - can be useful for colour and such
