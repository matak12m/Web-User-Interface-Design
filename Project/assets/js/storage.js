Naturally, I joined a team of students to make a Flower Dating Simulator. <br> The game combined elements of farming and typical visual novel dialogue, where you play as a gardener taking care of sentient flowers. Our team leader advocated for us to use Godot to develop the game, which was a challenge for us. <br></section><section class = "textExpanded"> My role on the team was the writer. We needed a lot of dialogue for the game, so I wrote about 6000 words of dialogue over 2 days, for 4 flowers with different personalities.  <br>I dipped my toes into Godot as well, but my main focus was on the writing.<br>You can check the github repo <a href ="https://github.com/MichaelRRyan/eROOTica"> here! </a> </section> <img id = "img-large" src = "assets/img/erootica_screenshot.png"> '

Out of a few ideas, our lecturer picked a fishing game for us to make. We divided ourselves into 2 programmers and 2 asset artists, and since we were learning pixelart at the time, we decided on a pixelart design.  </section> <section class = "textExpanded"> I was in charge of making the shop, for which i made this Flash game-like design.

A simple premise - copy answers from your classmate while the teacher is looking the other way, try to finish the test before the time runs out. if you get caught by the teacher, you lose! <br> This was inspired by many flash games that work on the same premise. The game is definitely a bit rough around the edges, but it still holds a special place in my heart.  </section><section class = "textExpanded"> This was mainly a programming project, but I also made my own assets - although they are very basic, they still work well enough for the game. <br> The animations of the player (triangle head) would follow your cursor, which had to be hovering above the classmates desk to copy answers. <br>You can check the project out <a href ="https://github.com/matak12m/cheat-your-way-through"> here! </a>  </section>  <section class = "textExpanded"> <img style = "float: left;" src = "assets/img/player-sprites.gif"> <img style = "float:left;" src = "assets/img/blockhead.gif"> </section> '
let OnTheClockHTML = '<a><img id = "img1" src = "assets/img/clock.png" alt="Clock with phases of the day drawn on it"> </a> <section class = "textExpanded"> This was my second year first semester project. Our goal was to make a game inside a webpage with a theme of time travel.<br> I chose to make a time-based puzzle, where you try to align schedules of your friends to meet up at the campfire at the same time. You can physically rotate the clock next to the game screen to change the time, and you can affect your friends schedules by interacting with the environment. <br> The game is technically finished, however, I plan on adding some quality of life features so that the gam ecan be played without a personal explanation.</section><section class = "textExpanded"> This was purely a programming project for me, as all the assets are borrowed from a free bundle called "Bloxburg" from itch.io. <p> You can play the current version of the game <a href ="https://matak12m.github.io/on-the-clock/"> here!</a>  <p> github repo: <a href = "https://github.com/matak12m/on-the-clock"> github.com/matak12m/on-the-clock </a>  </section>'

let aboutMeHTML = "I am a Czech student currently living in Ireland. I have always been fascinated by games. I have been making my own board games with cardboard scraps since I was a kid, but none of them really became popular outside my family. I also always loved art as a form of expression. <br> <br> When I was choosing a college to go to, I decided to go on my own path into a Games Development course in a whole different country, following that childhood hobby, as well as my interest in programming. I switched courses in my second year to Interactive Digital Arts and Design, to diversify my skillset apart from just programming, and found out that I really enjoy designing, both games and websites!  <br> <br> In my spare time I run the college's board game society, or I run, literally. I also like cooking and hiking, and I am a huge indie game fan. <br> <br> But enough about me, and more about my work!"
